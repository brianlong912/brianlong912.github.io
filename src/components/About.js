      <p>
        Personable and diligent, I am seeking a position to blend my passion for physics with my love for computer science.
        While these fields approach problem-solving in different ways, I am able to use my experience from
        both fields to find solutions from a unique perspective. A busy college schedule fostered my strong
        time management skills while enriching me with valuable leadership experiences. Adding in my love for
        triathlons and I have the determination to exhaust all possibilities.
